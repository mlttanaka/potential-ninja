Learning Rails
  ==
  Learning Rails with a tutorial from the [RailsApps] (http://railsapps.github.io/http://railsapps.github.io/) project.
	
  The author of the tutorial, Daniel Kehoe, also has a [kickstarter] (http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/909377477/learn-ruby-on-rails) 
  to fund the print version of the tutorial.  Feel free to contribute to it.  :-)
  
  My live version of this app lives on [heroku] (http://mlttanaka-learn-rails.herokuapp.com/). Take a peek at it.
